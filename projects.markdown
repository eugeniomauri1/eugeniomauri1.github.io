### **Optimal evolutionary paths in protein sequence**
Before switching to finance, I worked as a PhD student in Statistical Physics at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris. My main project was focused on utilizing simple neural networks to infere the fitness landscape of a protein family (in simple terms, a function that measures whether a given protein sequence is active or not) and apply it to find optimal mutational paths between distant proteins.
